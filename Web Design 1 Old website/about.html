<h1>About</h1>

<tr>
<td>
  <p>I'm Ruqaiyyah, but I go by Kya or Rose. I'm a 22yrs
    old graphic designer born in Philadelphia, Pa.
    I describe myself as alternative goth and angelic.
    I have been an artist for years, and art has been one of my major strengths.
    Art, to me, is often considered the process or product of deliberately arranging
    elements in a way that appeals to the senses or emotions. It encompasses various
    activities, creations, and methods of expression, including drawing,
    graphic design, music, gaming, acting, sculpture, and paintings.
    This is why I feel like I'm very skillful.</p>
