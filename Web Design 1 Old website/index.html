<h1>Welcome To My Winter Break</h1>

<p>Winter, winter, winter it's not my
  favorite nor do I hate it. It's just that
  things don't feel the same to me anymore.
  This past winter, I didn't enjoy it because
  I didn't do anything other than playing some
  video games with friends, celebrating my partner's
  birthday on Christmas Eve, capturing some
  black and white photographs, drawing, and
  taking care of my family. I wish I could say I did more.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as my winter break was dull, I have been managing
  to do a lot of self-care because having depression makes everything
   feel so melancholy. I manage to get more sleep, exercise,
   express myself more and try not to dwell on the bad things in life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feeling listless, sad or down most of the day, nearly every day</li>
  <li>Losing interest in activities I once enjoyed</li>
  <li>Having low energy and feeling sluggish</li>
  <li>Having problems with sleeping too much</li>
  <li>Having thoughts of not wanting to live</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
